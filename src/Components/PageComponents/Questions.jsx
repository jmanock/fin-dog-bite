      <h5 id='HowDoI'>How do I do this:</h5>
      <p>
        This is policy is just like any other policy, you get your quote, decide if you want to purchase and conclude the process. this is a FULLY automated program, it is designed to be easy , quick and convenient. It is also the reason the premium is less than most other policies.

    <div className='question'>
      <h5 id='whatIs'>What is a <span className='title-name'>Canine Liability Policy</span>:</h5>
      <p>
        It is a standalone policy that coers injuries or damages which are caused by your dog. Most people think only of dog bites; however, bites are just one reason people are suing dog owners. If your dog scratches, scares, causes a person to fall or if your dog injures another animal, it is likely you will hear from a lawyer. Coverage is provided on and off your premises anywhere in the United States. Many landlords and municipalities are requesting to be added as "Additional Insureds" providing them with liability coverage for injuries or damages caused by your dog and so they can be notified of any changes or cancellations.

      <h5 id='quote'>How do I get a quote:</h5>
      <p>
        Hit the "Get a Quote" button on the website. You will be asked to answer primarily drop down questions, then hit "calculate" at the bottom of the page. If you have more than one dog, there is an "Add Dog" button at the top left corner of the quote. You will need to answer the same questions for each dog. Please note that you are Never under any <b>OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE ANYTHING!</b>
      </p>

    <div className='question'>
      <h5 id='paymentPlans'>Do you have payment plans:</h5>
      <p>
        Payment options and plans will vary depending on the amount of the premium they will appear on the page with your quote. The <b>QUOTE</b> you will reveive is for an annual policy which is 12 months or one year. All payments must be received and authorized by either a debit or credit card processing company. The charges will appear on your statement from "Dual Commercial" they are assisting us. The only Rip Off reports about the program are the result of cancellation due to nonpayment of premiums, only the insurer can reinstate coverage we do not have the authority to without their approval. <b>There is no Deductible!</b>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className='question'>

      <p>
        We have four options for coverage $25,000, $50,000, $100,000 and $300,000. At this time we are unable to assist with higher limits such as $500,000 and up.

      <h5 id='behaviorHistory'>What if my dog has a behavior history or has been labeled dangerous by a governing body:</h5>
      <p>
        We are willing to review all dogs. You will be asked to give us information on the incident or incidents leading to the label. If your quote comes back as a "referral", that means the underwriters want to review your application closer. You will receive the final decision in a separate email.
